        <p>Wow! This tour made me realize how much I love mountains. After going<br>
          on one of these tours, I can safely say that they are my favorite geographic<br>
          feature, and my favorite word that starts with M.</p><br>

        <p>I never understood why people cared so much about mountains. But then<br>
          I went on one of these tours. Now I can't understand people who <em>don't</em><br>
          care about mountains!</p><br>
